# Kot2


It was a amazing week! I attended the 2nd edition of Koopman Operator Theory Workshop in Cres, Croatia. Great talks were presented from all of the participants. I met many colleagues in Koopman operators and dynamical systems. I really enjoyed the workshop in Moise Palace and the peaceful atomosphere in Cres ("no stress in Cres"). Looking forward to the 3rd edition in **Kyoto**!
